<h3 class="title">Colophon </h2>
<p>I built this site in HTML5 and CSS3 with Jekyll. The design is based on the version I created with
    Django in 2013, but I have revised the design of the page headers, refined the responsive elements
    and gone with a so-hip-it-hurts cards layout for the homepage. Hey, if it's good enough for Facebook,
    it's good enough for me. </p>

<p>The header font is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search/popgod/fonts/">Popgod</a> by 
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Device/">Rian Hughes</a> of Device Fontsâ€“ one of my 
    favourite illustrators and designers. The other fonts are variations on Helvetica Neue from 
    Fonts.com. </p>

<p>Web hosting is by <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/signup?affiliate=alanmoore">Webfaction</a>, 
    who I really like. In fact, I moved all my sites to them from (mt) Media Temple. </p>

<h3 class="title">Kit </h2>
<h4 class="subtitle">Hardware</h3>
<p>I work on a 2012 Apple 
    <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/897810-REG/Apple_z0np_md3886_Mac_mini_Desktop_Computer.html" 
    target="_blank">Mac Mini with a Quad-core i7 @ 2.5GHz and a 256Gb SSD</a>. I added 
    <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/1600DDR3S16P/" 
    target="_blank">16Gb RAM from OWC</a>, and two <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/ministack" 
    target="_blank">USB3 MiniStacks</a> to house 5Tb of external storage. Attached is a (sadly discontinued)
    <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-blackwidow/" target="_blank">
    Razer Blackwidow (Mac Edition)</a> keyboard, because I like mechanical keyboards. They go click.
    I point at things with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Bamboo-Create-CTH670-Version/dp/B005HGBF9W/" 
    target="_blank">Wacom Bamboo Create (6" x 4")</a> pen tablet my wife got me a couple of years 
    ago. </p>

<p>At work I use a 2014 MacBook Pro 15" with Retina Display, which is gorgeous to use, especially 
    with 16Gb RAM and that PCI SSD! </p>

<h4 class="subtitle">Software</h3>
<p>I spend most of my days in <a href="http://www.axure.com/" target="_blank">Axure RP 7.0</a> and 
    Bohemian Coding's <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch 3</a>. If I 
    have to write code (like for building this site), I do it in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com" 
    target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>, which I don't love, but it's the best there is right now. </p>

    <p>I'm waiting on <a href="https://affinity.serif.com" target="_blank">Affinity</a> to release 
    their InDesign killer and then I could happily dump the entire Adobe Creative Cloud. I'd only use 
    it when forced to at work. Between Sublime Text, Sketch, Pages and <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com" 
    target="_blank">Pixelmator</a>, I'm getting by pretty well. It would be a nice piece of poetic justice
    to see a successor to PagePlus take a chunk out of InDesign, just as it was great seeing InDesign,
    the successor to PageMaker, knock Quark XPress off it's perch ten years ago. </p>

<p>I augment my development tools with 
    <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/" target="_blank">CodeKit</a> and Git (specifically that 
    nice <a href="http://mac.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub for Mac</a> application) when 
    developing for myself. I have had to use <a href="http://gruntjs.com" target="_blank">Grunt</a> 
    in the past, but I bought my Mac for a reason, and it wasn't to edit config files.</p>

<p>I'm back using <a href="http://subversion.apache.org" target="_blank">Subversion</a> at work, 
    supplemented with <a href="http://versionsapp.com/" target="_blank">Versions</a> for the Mac. 
    But <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is how I roll at home. </p>

<p>As much as I'd like to never see 
    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/home" target="_blank">Windows</a> again, we 
    have to test our sites. I use <a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/" 
    target="_blank">Parallels Dekstop</a> because it came free with my Mac, and virtual machines 
    downloaded from <a href="http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads" 
    target="_blank">Modern.ie</a> courtesy of Microsoft. I also have to run Visual Studio at work, 
    but I'll be damned if I use it to do anything but run a local copy of the application.</p>

<p>My daily browsing is done in <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">Safari</a>, 
    and Flash is not installed on my system. The superior developer tools in 
    <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> make 
    that my development browser of choice, and its built-in implementation of Flash Player make it 
    my fallback when using sites that require it.</p>
