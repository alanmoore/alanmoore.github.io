intro: 			We let our client upload documents and select them from a dropdown menu. They added 302 documents, then complained it was hard to find the one they needed. 
---

<p>We never imagined that a client would need so many documents, but they apparently did. I got the
	brief: <em>Make it easier to select a document because the client says it's too difficult.</em> 
	I logged in to their environment and found they had added 302 documents, and were attempting to 
	find them in the drop-down menu. And the other constraint? Don't use up any more screen estate 
	with whatever solution I pulled out of my UX hat. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It was suggested that perhaps we offer them a way to search the documents. This seemed like 
	overkill. The seed of the idea - make it easy to find the correct document - was in that 
	suggestion, but rolling out a search field? Time for some research. </p>
<p>As it turned out, lots of the documents had very similar names: </p>
<ul>
	<li>109 instances of 'status' </li>
	<li>60 instances of 'parent'</li>
	<li>58 instances of 'student'</li>
	<li>30 instances of 'income'</li>
	<li>24 instances of 'review'</li>
	<li>21 instances of 'ISIR'</li>
	<li>20 instances of 'verification'</li>
	<li>14 instances of 'worksheet'</li>
</ul>
<p>So not really a useful solution. Even if we could add a search field that presented a dropdown
	selection control, something like an autocomplete, the odds were high that there would be too
	many options to comforatbly scroll through.</p>
<p>This was my solution: </p>

<p>Firstly, this is an unstyled prototype built in Axure RP 7. It's not supposed to be pretty, just
	to show a developer what they need to build. The part you're looking for is the label 
	'Document Requirement'. That link in blue next to the label is where the dropdown menu was 
	located. So what happens when that link is clicked on? </p>
<img src="/images/posts/multi-select-open.png" alt="select from 300 items" />
<p>We get two select lists, and the rest of the screen is pushed down to make space. I had played
	around with various other, more 'clever' ideas, but we really needed something simple. I had 
	been thinking about the pattern used when selecting fonts in OS X: Select a typeface and the
	variants are listed to the right. They update according to the weights and styles available
	in the font family you select. </p>
<p>We were already categorising document types (not in the categories shown here - I made those up
	for the demo) so listing categories would be simple. It was also important to have an 'All' 
	category as the default. There are always users who have become experts and know the first few
	letters of the document they want. Rather than take away their ability to type a couple of 
	letters and get the result they want, let them continue in the manner they've become 
	accustomed. </p>
<p>For the others, though, this is what they'd see after selecting a category from the left: </p>
<img src="/images/posts/multi-select-open-selected.png" alt="select from 300 items" />
<p>Much easier. And once they click the document they want: </p>
<img src="/images/posts/multi-select-closed-selected.png" alt="select from 300 items" />
<p>The link title has updated to show the name of the document, and it's still obviously a link. 
	Meantime, those giant select lists have disappeared from view and the user is free to work their
	way through the rest of the form. Clicking the link brings you back to the 'open' state: </p>
<img src="/images/posts/multi-select-open-selected-2.png" alt="select from 300 items" />
<p>The solution worked for the client, and was rolled out to all our clients. It's important to 
	remember that some great minds have been creating GUI interfaces for 30+ years, and have 
	encountered and solved similar problems. It's tempting to recreate the wheel in a flashy,
	modern manner, but sometimes, a better, simpler solution is best, even of it's not going to
	innovate. </p>
