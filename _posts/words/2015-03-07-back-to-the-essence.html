intro: 			Why I switched from a dynamic, database driven custom CMS to a system of plain text files containing HTML. 
---

<p>I've just rebuilt this site in the closest form I can comfortably get to old-fashioned HTML files: 
	Jekyll, some HTML templates, some minimal SASS and a whole bunch of text files. I can work 
	faster, with minimal set up, from almost anywhere. It wasn't supposed to be this way. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>During my last 6 months at Erickson Living, we were hunting for a CMS. My preferred idea, having 
	worked on the live site for 12 months and crafted it very carefully in then-new responsive 
	HTML5 and CSS3, was to find a solution that would allow us to break apart the static HTML pages 
	into templates. That way we wouldn't have to re-do all our hard work, and we wouldn't wind up
	with loads of highly-opinionated cruft from a CMS such as Wordpress. </p>
<p>My idea, then, was to build the site using Django. I knew it would allow us to rapidly model the
	data, give us a ready-to-go admin system to populate the database with, and reuse our existing 
	HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Once we'd done that, we could build a custom CMS for internal use, 
	since even with Django Suit installed, the admin system wasn't simple enough for the users in 
	the marketing department. </p>
<p>We were trying out numerous solutions, so I quickly built a proof-of-concept. Since I didn't 
	actually know Python or Django, I started with the tutorial on the Django site, and got a demo 
	up and running in a day. </p>
<p>In the end, they went with Drupal. Soon after that decision was made, I left. Coincidence? You be
	the judge. The thing was, I'd fallen in love with Django. To keep using it, I built the 
	previous version of this site, alanmoore.info, in Django, Python and PostgreSQL. Django just 
	suited my thought process&mdash; rather than contort your content to fit the way another 
	entity thought it should be structured, make the models fit your site's needs. </p>
<h3 class="title">Best Intentions </h3>
<p>When I worked for PBS, we worked, coincidentally, in Django. I quickly understood, seeing an 
	enterprise quality web application, how limited my knowledge was. No matter, I was working in 
	HTML, CSS and JavaScript through Django templates. My previous exposure helped. It did, 
	however, become apparent that the application powering alanmoore.info could be improved.</p>
<p>I bought a copy of Think Python, and a copy of Two Scoops of Django. I read them both and vowed
	to rebuild alanmoore.info the <em>right</em> way. It might be small, but the site would become
	an exemplary Django site. I'd even host it publicly on GitHub, because my code would be so 
	good. </p>
<h3 class="title">You'll never guess what happened next. </h3>
<p>Apologies for the link-bait subheading. Things fell apart within six months as I realised that,
	while I loved PBS, the people who were actually employing me, Celerity, had misled me a little 
	over the nature of the job. If I could have stayed directly working for PBS, I would have done,
	but the contract with Celerity prohibited that. </p>
<p>There was a silver lining: I would up moving to my current job, with Regent Education. I didn't
	even have time to rework my site, and then, adjusting to my second new job in less than a year, 
	thoughts of working on the site fell by the wayside. </p>
<h3 class="title">A change of format</h3>
<p>I've always been pretty good at keeping my portfolio up-to-date. I learned a long time ago that
	it's easier to write about work while it's fresh and you're still excited about it. Several 
	times, I've wanted to write about my work at Regent. The issue is that the work is not really
	portfolio material. </p>
<p>I'm working mostly on a large SaaS application for managing financial aid. I spend most of my 
	time in Axure RP 7 and Sketch 3, occasionally putting together proofs of concept in a JS Fiddle
	so the developers don't have to think about the HTML structure or the CSS. </p>
<p>Add to that the fact that I can't morally expose even screenshots of this tightly-guarded product
	to the world at large through this site (regardless of the fact maybe 12 people would see it), 
	and my trusty portfolio format is no longer tenable.</p>
<p>That's when it struck me that rearchitecting the Django application might take a <em>very</em>
	long time. And really, what was it for? It was Resume Driven Development, and a rather futile 
	take on RDD, because I'm unlikely to be building such solutions in the future. </p>
<h3 class="title">No more complex toolchains </h3>
<p>I've had many job titles over the years. Web designer, web developer, front-end developer, 
	UI/UX Engineer... but web development has changed. An influx of ex-Flash developers, high on
	the thought that ActionScript 3 isn't all that different from JavaScript, coupled with 
	traditional software developers, who want to treat front-end like it's the back-end, have caused
	a fundamental shift in the way we work. </p>
<p>Suddenly, a front-end person has to be a JS expert, know three or four frameworks, use a CSS 
	preprocessor, and often pretend progressive enhancement was never a thing. Throw in the need
	to minify and concatenate the huge amount of code being produced so it will load in less than 
	three minutes &mdash; seriously guys? a 2.5Mb website? &mdash; and people start talking about
	toolchains and workflow. </p>
<p>That all has its place, but this is a one-man site on a shared server. I can carefully code it to
	be small. I don't need a CMS. Frankly, flat HTML, CSS, JS and images should be enough. I can
	still use SASS for my CSS, but no-one else needs to use it so I can use CodeKit to manage it. A
	framework? Sure, but something small and non-opinionated like Inuit-CSS. Why use something as
	bloated as Bootstrap for a site this small? It's not like I don't know CSS. </p>
<p>Frankly, the only downside is the lack of templating for HTML. So I chose Jekyll. It runs 
	locally on my Mac for testing, I host it as my main GitHub pages at alanmoore.github.io, and 
	for redundancy, when I update, I SFTP the contents of the _site directory to a folder on my
	WebFaction server, where it's hosted as a static HTML site. </p>
<p>It's great to get back to straight web development again. So long as I have CodeKit running in 
	the background, a terminal window open to run the local Jekyll server, and GitHub for Mac when
	it's time to commit, I can just concentrate on writing words and tweaking HTML and CSS. </p>
