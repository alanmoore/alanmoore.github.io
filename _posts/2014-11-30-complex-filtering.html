intro: 			A concept for filtering large data tables displayed as grids.

<p>At Regent, we display large tables of data. When I say large, I mean 24 columns and 30,000 
	records.</p>
<p>With that much to choose from, the ability to filter the data displayed is <em>very</em> 
	useful. We use Kendo UI, and <a target="_blank"
	href="http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/filter-menu-customization">its grids include the 
	ability to filter by clicking an icon in the column's header</a>.</p>

<p>This isn't a terrible solution by any means, but when all 24 columns have the filter, and the
	data is large enough that one third of those columns extend off the screen, it can be difficult
	to tell, at a glance, which columns are filtered. It's impossible to see <em>how</em> they are 
	filtered, which is a problem regardless of the amount of data displayed. </p>
<p>Here's a JSfiddle of a filtering concept I put together. I needed a quick prototype, so 
	although you can <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/alan_moore_regent/ejggvLj0/" target="_blank">view 
	the fiddle in full here</a>, the code is <em>not</em> production ready. I recommend you view 
	the result using the link below. </p>

<p>Each of the columns which can be filtered are listed in the dropdown menu, but this also allows 
	the option of <em>not</em> filtering certain columns by simply leaving them out of the list. 
	This is a simple, flexible option for filtering large datasets. </p>
