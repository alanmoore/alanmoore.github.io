<p>MSG Design had a client who was launching a card-based education game for children. The site 
	was already built when I began work. I was asked to create a virtual example version of the 
	card game to try out online.</p>

<p>The Rhyme Times Tables concept uses a combination of pictures (objects that rhyme with each 
	number, i.e. three = Tree ), pattern (the layout of the pictures) and position of the number 
	on the card) to teach kids their times tables. It is aimed at ages four to seven.</p>

<p>Since the work was undertaken in 2009, the only cross-platform technology robust enough to 
	create such a game in was Flash.&nbsp;The final game gave&nbsp;a taste&nbsp;of two of the times 
	tables, allowing the children to practice them and then test themselves on a selection of 
	random cards.</p>
