<p>The Dutch Connection in Baltimore required a new web site for the opening of their second 
	flower shop.</p>

<p>They requested that the site should entice the customer to browse the shops, rather than be a 
	standard ecommerce florist site.</p>

<p>Visually, the structure is rigid, but uses circles, distorted rectangles and patterns to show a 
	more playful side. The menu is unusually prominent at the top of the page, providing much 
	information without being overbearing.</p>

<p>Video was used to add impact, and there are galleries of example products. The company logo of 
	three tulips did not scale well for the web, so I drew a simpler, bolder version which the 
	client liked so much they have used it as signage for the new store!</p>
