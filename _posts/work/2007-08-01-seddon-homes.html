<p>Seddon Homes, Eclipse&#39;s largest client at the time, is a blue-chip home builder with a 
	turnover of &pound;40m in 2007 (that&#39;s $90m in 2013 dollars). We were asked to rebuild 
	their site from the ground up.</p>

<p>Preliminary layouts were created by a graphic designer. The colours and fonts were approved for 
	style, but the client was unhappy with the layouts of the pages, yet unable to say why. I used 
	Andy Clarke&#39;s block-out technique, a kind of reverse wire-framing, to analyse the layouts. 
	The conclusion was that the sizing and positioning of the page elements did not reflect the 
	importance of the content, and made for a bad user experience (UX). I resized, moved or removed 
	elements and produced new visuals which followed the original guidelines for appearance. 
	Further inspiration was gathered from Khoi Vin&#39;s Subtraction.com website, which explains 
	the predominance of horizontal lines throughout the interior pages. </p>

<p>I built the site in content-first XHTML with CSS arranging the screen layout. I used Prototype 
	and AJAX to make select pages, such as the list of developments, elegant yet simple. I also 
	integrated Google Maps using their API, and we prominently placed a mix of video and still 
	photography on the home page (a blatant rip-off of the Aston Martin web site at the time).</p>

<p>This site was the largest project I completed at Eclipse, and represents the sum of my knowlege, 
	as of mid 2007, spilled out of my brain and on to the screen.</p>
