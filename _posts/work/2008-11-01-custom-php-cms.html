intro: A small, custom CMS for various educational clients

---
<p>In November 2008, I was approached by Elygra Marketing Services&nbsp;to provide a&nbsp;Content 
	qManagement System (CMS) for one of their local education authority websites. The site was 
	already built and simply needed the back-end to be created and the content areas plugged in to 
	the existing pages.</p>

<p>For such a simple project, most off-the-shelf commercial and open source CMS systems were 
	overkill. Rather than spend time trying to arduously contort Wordpress or Drupal configurations 
	to co-operate with the pre-designed sites, and spend hours recreating a designer&#39;s code and 
	CSS as proprietary templates, I elected to build a custom CMS. </p>

<p>The list of requirements was short so creation of an Object-Oriented PHP5 / PostgreSQL system 
	was easy and rapid. Thanks to this, I spent my time creating easy-to-use user interfaces as 
	opposed to training people to find their way around an off-the-shelf, overpowered CMS 
	interface. </p>

<p>The site was successful enough that I reused it, with some further customisation, on two further 
	projects for Elygra: one in December 2009 and the other in September 2010. In June 2012 I 
	converted the CMS to use MySQL since their hosting provider had dropped support for 
	PostgreSQL.</p>
