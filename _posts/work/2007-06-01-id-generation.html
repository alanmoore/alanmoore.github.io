<p>Seddon Homes wished to remove the Developments section from their Flash site and have the 
	individual pages targetable by Google Adwords. We needed to create the new pages in HTML, the 
	catch being that the resulting pages should not feel static next to the Flash site.</p>

<p>I built the pages in content-first XHTML, using CSS to place the elements around the screen. I 
	added motion to each development page by using Flash animations (clouds moving, lights 
	switching on/off, birds flying) which were seamlessly overlaid on the pages.</p>

<p>Finally, I created CSS rollovers for the large circular images, which degraded gracefully.</p>
