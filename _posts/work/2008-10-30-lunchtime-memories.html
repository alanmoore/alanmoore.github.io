<p>The site focused on presenting positive messages about school food by allowing the public to 
	submit their memories of school food and the staff who made it.</p>

<p>I used jQuery to provide some motion to the web site, and the jqUploader plugin which allows the 
	site user to upload a photo to the site.</p>

<p>A PHP/MySQL content management system (CMS) allows moderators to approve a submission for 
	appearance on the site, edit it, and promote to the front page if desired.</p>

<p>ImageMagick is used by the CMS to process submitted photos and turn them into the polaroids seen 
	on the site.</p>
