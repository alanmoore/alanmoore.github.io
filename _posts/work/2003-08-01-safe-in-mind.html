intro: A Flash toy created to promote Unkle's second album.

---
<p>James Lavelle, head of Mo&#39;Wax Records and the sole consistent member of the group Unkle, 
	wanted to use his bands&#39; grass-roots following to create hype for their second album, 
	<em>Never, Never Land</em>.</p>

<p>He contacted the site <a href="http://www.unkle77.com" target="_blank">unkle77.com</a> and 
	provided them with samples of a track from the album. They asked me to create a toy to allow 
	users to play the loops and create their own song. I put it together very quickly in Flash and 
	ActionScript. The user could play once, play on a loop, stop and adjust the volume of each 
	sample.</p>

<p>Donal at Unkle77 skinned the final Flash files and it provided much amusement while it was 
	online.</p>
