<p>The Crayon Cuties Designer is a Flash-based application which allows customers to create a 
	family of cartoon characters, customizing their clothes and appearance, and place them on 
	checks, checkbook covers and address labels.</p>

<p>Following an unsuccessful build by an offshore team, I was tasked with redesigning and 
	developing its replacement.&nbsp;I created extremely in-depth UI designs in Fireworks CS3, 
	focused on creating an engaging and easy customer experience, with obvious nods to the Mii 
	designer on the Nintendo Wii.</p>

<p>The tool was created with Flex 3 and went through constant revision between April 2010 and 
	January 2011. At all stages, we reviewed and discarded any changes which decreased the 
	customers&#39; enjoyment of the process.</p>
