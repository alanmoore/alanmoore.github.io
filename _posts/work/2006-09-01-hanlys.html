intro: A web-based system for managing a home search company.

---
<p>In 2004, Eclipse helped start up a new company, Home Hunt UK. They provided a service whereby 
	they search for suitable homes to meet the requirements of busy executive clients lacking the 
	proximity or availability to search properly themselves. I built a web-based application 
	allowing the HHUK to work via the web, avoiding costly hardware and software fees.</p>

<p>After a year, the client made the decision to re-launch the business as Hanlys, and I took the 
	project on personally, outside of Eclipse. The system was rebuilt from scratch in PHP 4 and 
	MySQL, building on lessons learned from the experience of the previous year. Hanlys expanded to 
	become a national operation, licensing regions to licensees. All licensees worked through the 
	central web server, using the online system, managed centrally by the head of the company.</p>

<p>The application was made up of two sections:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Control System allowed the company head to define all options available to the licensee 
		in the Licensee System. It also controlled all licensee accounts within the system, 
		including setting up new regional licensees and their employees.</li>
	<li>The Licensee System allowed the licensee to add/remove/edit properties, clients, estate 
		agents, and local facilities. They could also define local areas by postcode and then 
		populate these with the above data types. The system matched clients with properties 
		meeting their requirements, which the licensee then sorted manually, for the personal 
		touch, before sending an automated email to the client. They could also send the client 
		information on the area based upon the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apache was configured on a new web server with SSL. Several databases were designed and then 
	constructed in MySQL. Secure administration areas were then defined, and all the above systems 
	were created in PHP.</p>

<p>After a few years, the owner of Hanlys, Alison, left the UK and sold the company to a 
	licensee.</p>
