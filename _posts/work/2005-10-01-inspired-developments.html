<p>Seddon Homes created a new &#38;redevelopment&#39; property company, specializing in urban 
	redevelopment targeted at under 30&#39;s with designer city lifestyles. Eclipse came up with 
	the company name, created the logo and Corporate ID, and were responsible for all marketing 
	efforts. </p>

<p>The lead designer and I collabprated on the look and feel of their web presence. I built the web
	site entirely in Flash, using a lot of ActionScript and traditional Flash animation.</p>

<p>The eye logo contains an eyeball which always points towards the current cursor position.</p>

<p>Each page includes a hand-drawn &#38;pop-art&#39; style image of the property, which draws 
	itself, then filters from TV interference to one or more pictures of the property. Each of 
	these was hand drawn by the designer and then I manually animated them.</p>
