<p>I accepted a three month contract with GMS (Graham&#39;s Machinery Sales), a trade supplier of 
	machine tools nationwide, in mid 2002. The brief was to completely redesign their website, get 
	it visible on search engines, and build it in such a way that they could later integrate an 
	e-commerce solution. </p>
<p>Development proceeded as follows:</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Requirements gathering </h3>
<p>Consultations with two of the owners, the IT Manager, main sales staff and an MBA to develop a 
	picture of the business and a feel for the industry. This was then honed into a set of 
	technical, design, marketing and information requirements. This took about a week.</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Information Architecture / Graphic Design </h3>
<p>With a large amount of information on the site, and the likelihood of expansion, the content 
	had to be organised in such a way as to be easy to navigate and find. This was immediately 
	followed by production of three designs for the site, followed by iterations of the chosen 
	design until a final design was agreed. The UI of the site was dictated by the IA, and heavily 
	influenced by Hillman Curtis&#39; site of the time. The whole process took about three 
	weeks.</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Site production </h3>
<p>HTML, CSS and Flash development, building the entire site. This was the largest of the stages of 
	development.</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Deployment </h3>
<p>Once approved, the site was launched and made live.</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Search Engine and Directory registration </h3>
<p>In 2002 there were many search engines and directories to register with: Yahoo, Yahoo Directory, 
	Open Directory and Google were very important, as were a host of others (if you remember these 
	names, you&#39;re old): Lycos, AltaVista, MSN, AOL, Excite and Ask Jeeves plus a few more I 
	don&#39;t even remember. It took about a week to create descriptions and keywords/key phrases 
	and do the registration.</p>
