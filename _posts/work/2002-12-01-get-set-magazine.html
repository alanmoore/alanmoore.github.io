<p>WMDC published this independent magazine to encourage teenagers finishing school who felt 
	university was not right for them to try alternative further education options. </p>

<p>The site was to be bright and colourful and appealing to teenagers. It featured various C-list 
	celebrities that failed to disguise that it was supposed to be educational. The layouts had 
	already been designed, but as is often the case, what looks great in Illustrator when it can 
	be zoomed easily does not translate easily to the 950 pixel width screen size we designed to 
	at the time. </p>

<p>The main issue was the persistent, screen-wide, graphical navigation area, which ate up a lot 
	of vertical space. Inspired by the then-hip Flash work of Joshua Davis of Praystation fame, I 
	suggested placing a tab to the left so that the menu could be opened and closed as needed. 
	Since this reduced its prominence, I then made that tab follow the mouse vertically to attract 
	the eye. That way, if your mouse had been at the top of the screen when you clicked 
	&#38;MENU&#39;, the menu would cover the top portion of the site. This both provided enough 
	vertical space to fit the content to the screen better, and a more edgy, interactive feel to 
	the site. </p>

<p>The build involved lots of things that are now irrelevant to web development: attempting to get 
	Illustrator graphics elements into Flash MX, using ActionScript to load elements dynamically to 
	allow easy updating of the site, and so on. Once the site was built, three quarterly 
	&#38;issues&#39; were published by placing new contents into the framework I built. </p>
