<p>PBS LearningMedia gives teachers direct access to thousands of classroom-ready, 
	curriculum-targeted digital resources, such as videos, audio, documents, and in-depth lesson 
	plans. </p>
<p>Succinctly described as 'a YouTube for education' by the product manager, this design had been 
	created over 12 months of revisions by the UX designer, then the UI designer, until it finally 
	reached my desk. </p>
<p>The site is a Django application, so I started by building full HTML pages for the two 
	variations using HTML5, Bootstrap, LESS, BEM notation and OOCSS concepts. I added minimal 
	JavaScript (enough to make the few necessary JS functions work) and selected the Owl Slider for 
	the carousel. At this point, I made sure that progressive enhancement was used throughout. </p>
<p>Particular attention was given to the different navigation types, since they varied significantly 
	at different breakpoints, and did not neatly fit with any standard Bootstrap components. </p>
<p>Once the pages were built, they were handed to an offshore developer, who broke them down into 
	Django templates, at which point they returned to me for finessing, since they now used real 
	data rather than dummy text and images. Several further rounds of revisions ensued, instigated 
	by both the UI and UX designers, and myself, based on our findings as the pages were built. </p>
<p>While this was going on, other parts of the site were being built by local and offshore 
	front-end developers. I left PBS in April 2014, and the new site launched in August of the same 
	year. I couldn't say how much of my code is used elsewhere in the site, but at the time of 
	writing it makes up significant portions of the home pages and site-wide navigation. </p>
