<p>A local artist, Robbie Stocker, required a portfolio web site to display his sculpture, photography, paintings and public works.</p>

<p>Due to a clerical error, the client had been guaranteed a price for the build, and the design 
	costs were spiraling. This left an incredibly short amount of time in which to build the site.</p>

<p>Originally intended to feature a page for each piece of art, the site was likely to be in 
	excess of 100 pages. I suggested instead that Lightbox2 be implemented, removing the need for 
	individual pages. This allowed us to come in merely a couple of hours over budget, as opposed 
	to tens of hours over.</p>

<p>The site is content-first XHTML with a CSS layout and Lightbox2 installed.</p>
