intro: 			A website built to meet W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

<p>In the UK, accessibility has long been built into law, and public institutions such as civil 
	service, colleges/universities, local government et al are audited. Many businesses can ignore 
	their legal requirements in such matters, but Oaklands College could not.</p>

<p>Nowadays, we would build content-first sites and use progressive enhancement so that all users 
	got a great experience, but this was 2002, their site was already built, and browsers 
	weren&#39;t too smart. Safari and Firefox were unknown and JavaScript implementation was janky. 
	The only solution was to construct a separate site with accessibility in mind and link to it 
	from the main site. That&#39;s what we did.</p>

<p>It took a lot of research into (a) legal requirements and (b) W3C&#39;s Web Content 
	Accessibility Guidelines before work could commence. I even installed a copy of the text-only 
	web browser Lynx to simulate the experience of using a screen reader for the partially / fully 
	blind.</p>

<p>The result was a large, plain, stripped-down, high contrast site with large type and all images 
	replaced with greyscale versions. While it wasn&#39;t &#38;pretty&#39;, it did meet all the 
	usability and accessibility requirements, and was good experience that went on to become very 
	useful once CSS layouts became mainstream three or so years later.</p>
