intro: I redesigned this financial calculator to make it easier to use on small screens
---
<p>On of Regent's newer products is an online financial calculator which can be customised and 
	branded for schools and other educational institutions. It guides students through a 
	questionnaire which takes their personal information, applies it to their preferred program
	and length of study, and outputs the funding available to them from grants, loans, scholarships
	and other sources. This enables the student to make an informed decision– <strong>Can I afford
	to go to school?</strong> </p>
<p>The product is live, but I was asked to make it work for smaller screens. I knew that the 
	existing design would be unsuitable for use on small tablets and smartphones, so I set about
	researching ways to improve it. </p>
<h4 class="subhead">Research</h4>
<p>I was armed with the following assumptions: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Financial Aid is hard to understand </li>
	<li>It is better to walk a user through a process than give them opaque questions and hope for 
		good answers </li>
	<li>Users with full-time jobs may not have time to perform adequate research, so we should 
		give them as much information during the process as is possible </li>
	<li>All users are intimidated by long forms: break up the questions into small, easy-to-
		undertsand chunks </li>
	<li>We cannot presume the user is using a desktop or laptop </li>
</ul>
<p>With no customers to interview, I relied on the data published by a cross-section of Regent 
	clients to generate demographics. I found that on average: </p>
<ul>
	<li>72% are female </li>
	<li>41% are minorities </li>
	<li>12% speak another language first language, then English </li>
	<li>76% are over 30 years old </li>
	<li>50% work full-time and will continue to do so alongside college </li>
	<li>20% are returning graduates </li>
	<li>21% use their phone as their primary internet browser </li>
	<li>37% own a tablet </li>
</ul>
<p>These nuggets of information helped underline to assumptions and helped develop clear goals for
	creating a new design. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">Analysis of the existing design </h4>
<p>I analysed the existing design with the presumption that any where between 21% and 58% of users 
	would not be on using a computer. I mmarked out the following technical requirements: </p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>&nbsp;</th>
		<th>Smartphone</th>
		<th>Computer</th>
		<th>Tablet</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Single / multitasking</th>
		<td>Single-task</td>
		<td>Multi-task</td>
		<td>Single-task</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Typical screen orientation</th>
		<td>Portrait</td>
		<td>Landscape</td>
		<td>Portrait and Landscape</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Screen size</th>
		<td>4” to 7”</td>
		<td>11” to 27”</td>
		<td>7” to 10”</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Screen resolution (points)</th>
		<td>320x480 to 480x800</td>
		<td>1280x800 to 1920x1080</td>
		<td>768x1024 or 800x1200</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Next, I broke down the functional areas of screen used in the existing design and ranked them
	in importance: </p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Area </th>
		<th>Functionality </th>
		<th>Rank </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Questionnaire</td>
		<td>Main interactive area</td>
		<td>1st</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Plan Progress Information</td>
		<td>Running total, funding status</td>
		<td>2nd</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Progress Bar</td>
		<td>Displays progress as percentage</td>
		<td>3rd</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>Tabs</td>
		<td>Navigate to previous sections</td>
		<td>4th</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Breadcrumbs</td>
		<td>Navigate to previous subsections</td>
		<td>5th</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>I also noted that the questionnaire screens were often made up of smaller subsections, and that
	many questions changed dynamically, depending on earlier responses. Observing our QA team test 
	the application, it was common to see them miss a question which had appeared between two 
	others. With anything up to 10 questions visible when entering a page, it was unsurprising that
	sometimnes the user would not notice until they clicked 'next' and the validation alerted 
	them. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">UX/UI Design</h4>
<p><strong>Sadly, I can't show the design here. Development is currently on hold, and I'm not 
	comfortable displaying it online before it goes live. </strong></p>
<p>The decison was made to show only the top three ranked areas. Additionally, I identified that 
	the Plan Progress Information was updated so infrequently during the process. Since it was 
	likely to become mere cognitive noise unless attention was drawn to it when it was updated,
	it should only be displayed on the smaller screens when an update occurred. The screen should,
	in fact, consist only of the progress bar and either the Questionnaire or the Plan Progress
	Indicator&mdash; the Plan Progress being displayed between questionnaire screens when it had 
	been updated. </p>
<p>I also decided that screens with subsectons should instead be mutliple screens, one per 
	subsection, and that only one question should be visible on entering a screen. As each question 
	was completed, the next question would appear below it. This avoided any missed additions to the
	screen and focused the user on the question to hand, not one further down the screen. It still 
	allowed the user to change previous answers. </p>
<p>All informational and help text was to be displayed inline, rather than hidden behind help icons.
	The Progress Bar would update after every question, not just between screens. A conversational 
	tone would be adopted to make the process less intimidating, and required documentation (W2, 
	FAFSA, etc.) would be listed <em>before</em> the process began to prevent users leaving the 
	process half-completed while they searched for the required information. </p>
<p>The user would be informed what the process included before beginning, and how it would benefit
	them. When a summary screen is displayed, it informs the user why it is being shown and when 
	they will see it again, and then indicates what will happen when they hit 'Next'. </p>
<p>Buttons would be descriptive: 'Start' rather than 'Begin My Future'; 'Save and Continue' 
	rather than 'Next'. Questionnaire labels would be reworded to be friendly and indicate if they
	directly affect the user: 'I would like to learn' [online]/[On-campus] rather than 'Location';
	My chosen program is' rather than 'Program'. Even dates would be presented in a friendlier 
	format: '11 August 2014' rather than '08/11/14'.</p>
<p>I also revised the final summary screen to make it much easier to read, to highlight the most 
	important information (Which years are funded/underfunded?), and to clearly indicate what the
	user should do next. Describing it any further would be an exercise in futility, so I'll wait
	until I'm able to post screenshots, rather than waste any more time. </p>
