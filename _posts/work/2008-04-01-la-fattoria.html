<p>I designed the page layout in Fireworks and coded the pages, content-first, in XHTML with CSS 
	for the layout.</p>
<p>The Menu and Wine List pages draw their data from a MySQL database using PHP. Having built the 
	database I created an Administration area in PHP to act as a Content Management System (CMS) 
	for the restaurant owners.</p>
