<p>Proximo insure commercial vehicles such as taxis. They wanted a new Flash web site. By this 
	point in 2006, browsers were capable of more than table layouts, so we suggested an HTML site. 
	They approved the idea, provided the new site was as slick as their previous Flash site.</p>

<p>For its time, the layout of the page was innovative, yet still easy to navigate. Overflowing 
	content was scrolled and the menus had drop-downs as required&ndash; all created in standards-
	compliant XHTML with image replacement used to maintain font styles.</p>

<p>This is a good example of a site which was standards compliant, innovative, yet still 
	appropriate for B2B use.</p>
