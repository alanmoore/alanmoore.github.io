intro: 			My approach to coding, circa March 2014
---
<p>When I built the prototype homepage for <a href="/work/pbs-learning-media">PBS Learning 
	Media</a>, I did not do it in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Indeed, there was a whole offshore development team, plus another front-end person in the office 
	in Arlington. This meant it became necessary to document my work, to articulate the philosophy
	with which I'd built the site. </p>
<p>That document is somewhere deep in the PBS intranet, and sharing it would likely result in me
	being shot by someone from Downton Abbey or Sesame Street, I do have my original notes to hand, 
	and I thought I might share them with the world, once they've been sanitised.</p>
<h3 class="title">A development philosophy </h3>
<h4 class="subtitle">LESS</h4>
<p>Create a separate .less file for each major section the the site. Currently, there is a 
	static/station/less/homepage.less file, which compiles into static/station/css/homepage.css. 
	Other files should be created in the static/station/less folder. </p>
<p>The first file to be imported is base.less, which sets up the site-wide styles and objects for 
	the site. We'll use homepage as an example for ongoing development. </p>
	<pre><code>@import 'base'; </code></pre>	
<p>This is followed by the objects and styles created specifically for the homepage section: </p>
<pre><code>
@import 'homepage-global';	
@import 'objects/register-box';
@import 'objects/carousel';
@import 'objects/featured-items';
@import 'objects/news-stories';
</code></pre>
<h4 class="subtitle">LESS Folder Structure </h4>
<p>Before we go any further, let's look at the structure of the less folder: </p>
<pre><code>
/less
 + /fonts
 + /modules
 + /objects
 + /partials
 + /vendor
   base.less
   custom-bootstrap-variables.less
   custom-bootstrap.less
   homepage-global.less
   homepage.less
   main.less
</code></pre>
<p>Vendor code such as the less files from Bootstrap sit in the /vendor folder. In the case of 
	Bootstrap, it has multiple .less files, and so gets its own subdirectory. Single files could 
	sit in the /vendor root. </p>
<p>The fonts folder, surprisingly, contains the font files. </p>
<p>All of the .less files are split into three folders: modules, objects and partials. The 
	modules folder contains .less files that do not output any CSS (mixins, variables and helper 
	functions). Partials are the meat of the CSS - typographic rules, responsive styles and so 
	forth. Finally, the objects folder contains reusable objects, such as the site navigation, 
	header, search bar and footer. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">Bootstrap 3</h4>
<p>The site uses Bootstrap 3. To keep it modular (and therefore easy to maintain), Bootstrap's 
	.less files are used, rather than rather than a compiled CSS file. </p>
<pre><code>
/less
 + /vendor
   + /bootstrap
     alerts.less
     badges.less
     bootstrap.less
     ...
     variables.less
     wells.less
 </code></pre>
<p>Bootstrap is large and somewhat unweildy. Rather than @import 'vendors/bootstrap/bootstrap', 
	the booststrap.less file has been duplicated to /less/custom-bootstrap.less and it has been 
	edited. Any Bootstrap component not yet needed in the site has been commented out and is not 
	imported. This reduces the size of the generated CSS files considerably. If, for example, 
	Bootstrap tables need to be added to the site, just uncomment the line 
	//@import "vendor/bootstrap/tables.less"; and recompile the CSS files. </p>
<p><strong>When upgrading Bootstrap, compare this file to the upgraded bootstrap.less in the 
	vendors/bootstrap folder, and make sure any changes are reflected in 
	custom-bootstrap.less. </strong></p>
<p>There is a custom implementation of the vendor/bootstrap/variables.less file, 
	custom-bootstrap-variables.less. Certain Bootstrap defaults required overriding to match the 
	design. Rather than duplicate the entire file, only the sections being altered have been 
	copied into custom-bootstrap-variables. Since Bootstrap's original variables file is over 
	800 lines long, this makes spotting changes easier, and should ease the difficulty of 
	upgrading. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, three section have been placed in the custom file: Media query 
	breakpoints, Grid System variables and Container Sizes. </p>
<h3 class="title">OOCSS and Modularity </h3>
<p>With such a large site, reusability, portability and modularity of existing code is important. 
	This is why the code has been written following (loosely) Object-Oriented CSS (OOCSS) 
	concepts. </p>
<p>The site is split into objects (a header, a footer, a carousel) and these objects are split 
	into their own files. This way, they can be easily added or removed from a page's CSS as 
	necessary using LESS @includes. </p>
<p>OOCSS requires the use of class names rather than specific selectors. Consider a navigation: </p>
<pre><code>
	&lt;nav role="navigation"&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;a href="#"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;SubNav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;SubNav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>These elements can be targeted like so: </p>
<pre><code>
nav[role="navigation"] {...}		/* 1 */
nav[role="navigation"] ul {...}		/* 2 */
nav[role="navigation"] li {...}		/* 3 */
nav[role="navigation"] a {...}		/* 4 */
</code></pre>
<p>Item 1 is fine, but items 2, 3 and 4 will be applied to the sub-nav, which can produce undesired 
	results. There is, of course, specifity: </p>
<pre><code>
nav[role="navigation"] ul ul {...}		/* 5 */
nav[role="navigation"] ul ul li {...}	/* 6 */
nav[role="navigation"] ul ul a {...}	/* 7 */
</code></pre>
<p>Things are getting complicated. In the pursuit of 'clean' markup, this kind of spaghetti CSS is 
	often a side-effect. Revisiting this code months later, it can take a while to understand what 
	is happening, and it is not clear what the effects of changing nav[role="navigation"] ul {...} 
	might be, until the cascade is fully understood. </p>
<p>Consider the following: </p>
<pre><code>
&lt;nav role="navigation" class="main-nav"&gt;
	&lt;ul class="nav-list"&gt;
		&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="nav-link"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="`link"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
			&lt;a href="#" class="nav-link"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;ul class="sub-nav"&gt;
				&lt;li class="sub-nav-item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="main-nav__sub-menu-link"&gt;SubNav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li class="main-nav__sub-menu-item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="main-nav__sub-menu-link"&gt;SubNav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>At first glance, this looks messier. But consider this CSS: </p>
<pre><code>
.main-nav {...}		/* 1 */
.nav-list {...}		/* 2 */
.nav-item {...}		/* 3 */
.nav-link {...}		/* 4 */
.sub-nav {...}		/* 5 */
.sub-nav-item {...}	/* 6 */
.sub-nav-link {...}	/* 7 */
</code></pre>
<p>
Not only is the CSS easier to parse, but a change to .main-nav cannot affect .sub-nav like a 
	change to nav[role="navigation"] ul can affect nav[role="navigation"] ul ul as we have 
	sidestepped CSS inheritence. Individual classes do not have to be declared for every level: if 
	submenu links are the same as main menu links then use .nav-link for both and don't declare 
	.sub-nav-link. </p>
<p>As a bonus, we can use these styles anywhere in the site without worrying about the HTML markup 
	around the targeted element causing strangeness. Even better, it doesn't matter what kind of 
	element we use, which allows for flexibility when changing the HTML. We are free to choose the 
	best HTML structure for the job in hand without altering our CSS. </p>
<p>OOCSS Does not require a class to be attached to every HTML element. Instead, you should attach 
	a class to any element you wish to style.Always prefer a new class rather than a complex 
	selector. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">Use Verbose HTML </h4>
<p>It is a measure of pride for developers that we can use very little markup to acheive our goals. 
	A side-effect of this methodology is convoluted CSS. OOCSS works better with extra code,  which 
	makes separating objects from the overall page markup a more achievable task. Once outside 
	frameworks and plugins with their own JS and CSS are added, this becomes much more 
	important. </p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE: BOOTSTRAP GRIDS</strong><br />
	Consider Bootstrap grids. It is possible to work like so:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;div class="container-fluid"&gt;
	&lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;Subtitle&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;More Text&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The columns can be styled directly. Since .col-x has a margin-left and margin-right value, and 
	is floated, it immediately constrains the CSS that can be used to style it without breaking 
	the layout. Should position: be used, the grid will break. If the column's content needs a 
	margin or padding, allowances must be made for the inherited grid styles. The layout may break, 
	and this is more likely since the site has multiple breakpoints. Worse, if the grid behaviour 
	changes from one version to the next, upgrading becomes a more time-consuming endeavour. </p>
<p>Instead, consider this code: </p>
<pre><code>
&lt;div class="container-fluid"&gt;
	&lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
		&lt;div class="some-content"&gt;
			&lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
		&lt;div class="some-content"&gt;
			&lt;h2&gt;Subtitle&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;More Text&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, there is more markup. It was necessary to separate the grid from the content. There are now 
	more options available when styling the content, and changes can be made in the knowledge that 
	if Bootstrap changes .col-x to be an inline-block, or adopts flexbox, only the grid will 
	require debugging. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">More Markup = Less CSS Debugging</h4>
<p>A little more HTML is a small price to pay for easier maintainability and greater modularity. 
	Only other developers will see the HTML markup, but it's likely a lot ot time will be spent 
	debugging CSS. Knowing that one element cannot have an unexpected effect on another makes that 
	job much easier. </p>
<p>This predicatbility means that if .col-x wraps to another line, the issue is with the column, 
	not its contents. This means less time in the Element Inspector and a faster bug fix. Verbosity 
	in HTML code is a small price to pay for predictability. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">A Note on BEM Notation </h4>
<p>A problem with using classes throughout HTML markup is that eventually, a multiple-developer 
	team will accidently reuse an existing class. This is not fun. </p>
<p>BEM notation is a stylistic choice and stands for Block Element Modifier. It is a verbose method 
	of naming classes to avoid class name conflicts and make clear the structure of the object. </p>
<p>Consider our previous example: </p>
<pre><code>
&lt;nav role="navigation" class="main-nav"&gt;
	&lt;ul class="nav-list"&gt;
		&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="nav-link"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="nav-link"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
			&lt;a href="#" class="nav-link"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;ul class="sub-nav"&gt;
				&lt;li class="sub-nav-item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="main-nav__sub-menu-link"&gt;SubNav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li class="main-nav__sub-menu-item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="main-nav__sub-menu-link"&gt;SubNav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
</nav>
</code></pre>
<p>It uses this CSS:</p>
<pre><code>
.main-nav {...}		/* 1 */
.nav-list {...}		/* 2 */
.nav-item {...}		/* 3 */
.nav-link {...}		/* 4 */
.sub-nav {...}		/* 5 */
.sub-nav-item {...}	/* 6 */
.sub-nav-link {...}	/* 7 */
</code></pre>
<p>These are some generic class names. .nav-link may well be used elsewhere in error. </p>
<pre><code>
&lt;nav role="navigation" class="main-nav"&gt;
	&lt;ul class="main-nav__list"&gt;
		&lt;li class="main-nav__item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="main-nav__link"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li class="main-nav__item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="main-nav__link"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li class="main-nav__item"&gt;
			&lt;a href="#" class="main-nav__link"&gt;Nav Item&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;ul class="sub-menu"&gt;
				&lt;li class="sub-menu__item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="sub-menu__link"&gt;SubNav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li class="sub-menu__item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="sub-menu__link"&gt;SubNav Item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>At first glance, this looks messier. But consider this CSS: </p>
<pre><code>
.main-nav {...}					/* 1 */
.main-nav__list {...}			/* 2 */
.main-nav__item {...}			/* 3 */
.main-nav__link {...}			/* 4 */
.sub-menu {...}		/* 5 */
.sub-menu__item {...}	/* 6 */
.sub-menu__link {...}	/* 7 */
</code></pre>
<ul>
	<li>A Block has a single name, written .block, such as .main-nav. </li>
	<li>An Element is a child of the block and is written .block__element, such as .main-nav__item 
		or .main-nav__link. </li>
	<li>A modifier presents a modified version of a Block or Element and is written 
		.block--modifier or .block__element--modifier, such as .main-nav--active or 
		.main-nav__item--selected. </li>
</ul>
<p>BEM denotes the structure of the block, but the block can be placed anywhere in a page's HTML. 
	Nesting of blocks is not necessary. In this example, the .sub-menu is a separate block to the 
	.main-nav. It may be tempting to use .main-nav__sub-menu and then .main-nav__sub-menu__item, 
	but this is overly specific. </p>
<p>This defeats the goal of BEM, which is to clarify the structure of self-contained objects. A 
	.block such as .sub-menu should not require a container like .main-nav to exist. The .sub-nav 
	styling may be used on any page inside any other HTML is we decouple it from .main-nav. </p>
<p><strong>HTML denotes the hierarchy of the page, the BEM notation denotes the hierarchy of the 
	object. </strong></p>
<p>Not all elements inside an object need to be written in BEM. If the style of the element is 
	unique to that element, use .block__element. If there is a pre-existing .element elsewhere 
	that will work, use that instead. </p>
<p>As a reminder, BEM is a stylistic choice. It is not mandatory, but understanding it will make 
	the protoype easier to follow. </p>
<h3 class="title">JavaScript and Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>The prototype has been built using a philosophy of progressive enhancement: in short, if 
	JavaScript fails to load, contains an error, or is disabled, every function enhanced by 
	JavaScript will still work. This is the ESCALATORS VS ELEVATORS principle: if an elevator 
	breaks, it cannot be used. If an escalator breaks, it can be used as stairs. </p>
<p>The base.html template has a class of .no-js attached to the body. In the JS code, this is 
	removed and replaced with .js-active and this provides three layers of control: styles only 
	for non-JS pages (.no-js .selector), only for those with JS active (.js-active .selector), or 
	for both (.selector). </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">Classes for CSS, IDs for JavaScript </h4>
<p>99% of the time, it is cleaner to reference a class selector in CSS. This allows for modularity 
	and reusability. Combined with BEM, the CSS can be specific without falling into the 
	specicifity trap. An ID is 255 times more specific than a class. </p>
<p>However, when using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, it is more efficient to target a specific 
	target by ID. To this end, ID's are added to objects that will be targeted, but they are styled 
	in CSS using classes. The ID is only for targeting. </p>
<p>If a target's appearance needs to change, it is best to swap classes whenever possible rather 
	than rely on injecting inline CSS. Should the styles rely on computed values, inline CSS in 
	the JavaScript code is unavoidable. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">JavaScript-only Classes</h4>
<p>To make debugging easier and to provide a clear separation between inserted by JavaScript and 
	those that belong in the HTML markup, all inserted classes are prefixed 'js-'. For example, 
	when toggleElement() opens a previously hidden element, it adds a class of 'js-open'; 
	'js-active' is appened to the &lt;body&gt; tag upon successful load of the JS. This allows us to 
	move JS-injected CSS into the LESS files and out of the .js files whenever viable. </p>
<h3 class="title">Transitions: CSS vs. JS</h3>
<p>It is better to use a CSS transform than a JavaScript animation: the CSS transitions are 
	usually hardware-accelerated, and most JS animation requires significantly more screen 
	repainting (and therefore processor power) than a transition. Sometimes, these are 
	unavoidable. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">CASE STUDY 1: PAGES </h4>
<p>There are multiple 'pages' in the base template. Only one is visible at a time. Buttons can be 
	created that allow switching between pages. By using 'opacity: 0;' and 'opacity: 1;', 
	attaching a transition to the .page, and swapping classes, we get a fast, smooth, full-screen 
	transition between pages. Should a user be on an older browser, they still get the same swift 
	response, but they lose the animated effect. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">CASE STUDY 2: SEARCH FILTERS </h4>
<p>There are optional filters attached to the search bar. When these are revelaed, the rest of the 
	page moves down to make space, using jQuery slideUp() and slideDown(). The CSS transform 
	requires an explicit height in order to work, SlideDown() does not. It was undesirable to set 
	the height of the filter holder in CSS: it needs to be different at each breakpoint, and would 
	require changing whenever the contents or their styling changes. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">WHY USE ONE OVER THE OTHER? </h4>
<p>The other factor is one of UX: When we change an entire screen, the transition is a nice effect, 
	but since the change is so large, it is not necessary for the user to understand what has 
	happened. Conversely, when changing what might be a small area of the screen, the animation 
	helps draw the eye to the change. This is why the eveal of the search criteria must be 
	animated, but the page chanmge does not require it. </p>
<h4 class="subtitle">Conclusion</h4>
<p>If the UX requires animation, use transitions (provided they will work), or JS animations if 
	they won't. </p>
<h3 class="title">Postscript</h3>
<p>That's all there is of my documentation that I can publish. It's certainly not a complete
	philosophy and it's definitely not one-size-fits-all, but perhaps it might set your mind going
	and launch you to even greater heights. Or not. </p>
