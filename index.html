<section>
    <p>Hello, I'm Alan. I design and build user interfaces for web applications, focusing on user interactions and
        experience. I've been working with the web for over 23 years, so I can speak developer as well as user experience.
        I live in beautiful Yellow Spings, Ohio with my wife, five cats and a pit bull. I work remotely for Designers Axis
        in Los Angeles, California. </p>

    <h1 class="page-header">Interaction Design for SAAS Applications</h1>
    <p>For the last 7 years, I have worked almost exclusively, in UX roles, on Enterprise/SaaS applications. Here's
    a quick summary of what I've been up to. </p>

    </div>

    <p>In 2016, I joined ACGI Software in Columbia, MD. Embedded in the engineering team, I again found myself working on
        enterprise software. This time, it was a large and complex Association Management Software (AMS) suite. Each
        installation was specific to the customer, containign a combination of up to 40 modules, with layers of customization
        on top.</p>
    <p>The stack itself spanned numerous technologies, having been continuously improved and added to since 1998, and </p>

    <div class="header-with-logo header-with-logo--regent  header-with-logo--first">
        <img src="/images/logos/regent-logo.svg" alt="Regent Education logo" class="company-logo  company-logo--regent">
        <h2 class="section-header">Regent Enterprise Management</h2>
    </div>
    <p>In 2014, I transferred into full-time Interaction Design when I moved to Regent Education, a software company in
        Frederick, MD. Their main product at the time was a suite of software used by institutions such as colleges to
        calculate, award and manage financial aid for students. Their unique selling point was being the only suite that
        allowed for non-traditional school terms, meaning they could manage everything from a standard, 4-year degree to
        one taken part-time over ten years. </p>
    <p>Amongst other things, I conducted an <a href="#">extensive heuristic review</a> of Regent's then-current software
        suite, Regent Enterprise Management 8. Other highlights included the creation of a
        <a href="#">Student Financial Calculator</a>, one of the few products intended to be publicly facing. </p>
    <p>Typically, though, I worked on smaller problems, such as dealing with <a href="#">very large tables on small screens</a>,
        or <a href="#">dropdowns that a customer had populated with 300+ items</a>. Alongside those I tackled larger redesign
        and optimisation efforts, which resulted in these <a href="#">requirements for a commonly-used and complex
            screen</a>.</p>=
