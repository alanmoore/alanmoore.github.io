<p>Hello, I'm Alan. I design and build user interfaces for web applications, focusing on user interactions and
    experience. I've been working with the web for over 23 years, so I can speak developer as well as user experience.
    I live in beautiful Yellow Spings, Ohio with my wife, five cats and a pit bull. I work remotely for Designers Axis
    in Los Angeles, California. </p>
